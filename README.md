# NestMonitor
Monitors the state of objects from the Google Nest API

I can write up a more helpful explanation of how to get a standard rather than "Commercial" account from the Google Nest SDM developer team to work with an app. This is just a prototype so requires entering a clientID and projectID manually prior to compiling the app. Once done (and once permissions on the IDs used are configured properly), the app queries devices and then displays an arrow of whether the device is reachable or not.
